# Game Of Life in Clojure

For the last session of [GDC14](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) I
paired with another developer on a Clojure implementation. My Clojure
was rusty but we managed to get through some of the basics. When I got
home I decided to try my hand and putting together a full implementation
in Clojure.

I'm currently looking for feedback on how I can refactor this code base
to be both idiomatic, readable, and performant.

## Usage
```
lein deps
lein specs
lein run
```
